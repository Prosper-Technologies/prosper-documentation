## Overview

Campaigns are used to group similar types of inbound or outbound calls. Each campaign defines:
- The AI voice agent to be used.
- QA settings for monitoring call quality.
- Post-call data extraction settings.

While campaigns can be created via the API, we **recommend cloning campaigns through the API** and performing all campaign definitions, especially post-call data configuration, via the Prosper platform.

## Steps to Execute Calls within a Campaign

### 1. Add Targets to a Campaign

Once a campaign is created, targets must be added using the [Add Targets](/api-reference/campaigns/add-targets) endpoint:

```http
POST /campaigns/{campaign_id}/targets
```

**Targets** contain the specific information required to execute each call, such as the phone number and any relevant metadata.

### 2. Execute Calls

After adding targets, execute calls by specifying which targets to include in the [Campaign Call](/api-reference/campaigns/campaign-call) endpoint:

```http
POST /campaigns/{campaign_id}/call
```

This endpoint can execute calls for specific targets or for all targets in the campaign.

### 3. Receive Call Results

Each campaign defines a **customizable webhook** to receive call results. Once a call is completed, the webhook will receive the `call_log_id`.

### 4. Retrieve Call Logs

Using the `call_log_id`, detailed information about the call can be retrieved with the following endpoint:

```http
GET /call_logs/{call_log_id}
```

This provides access to all relevant call data, including transcripts, metadata, and outcomes.
